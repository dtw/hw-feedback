Adds rate and review support for Health and Social Care services in WordPress.

## Description

Adds support for managing and displaying Health and Social Care services in WordPress. Allows anonymous/public users to rate and review these services. This is achieved through custom post types and taxonomies. The standard comment form is repurposed as feedback form. Other features include Dashboard items and widgets. The plugin also checks service information against the Care Quality Commission (CQC) database and allows newly added services to be imported directly.

NOTE: this plugin was originally created so that the display of services could be customised. However, with the integration of CQC data, this customisation is now limited. Local service categories and descriptors must align with the CQC taxonomies.

Not Gutenberg compatible.
